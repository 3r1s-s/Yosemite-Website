            <p>
                Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.
                <br>
                <br>
                Top Things to Know:
            </p>
            <ul class="small">
                <li>Plan ahead: reservations are not currently required to enter Yosemite, but we strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking.</li>
                <li>Pack your patience: millions of people visit Yosemite from April through October. Yosemite Valley is the main destination for most visitors but there are many places to go in the park.</li>
                <li>Early birds avoid traffic! From spring through fall, arrive in the park before or after peak hours (before 9 am and after 5 pm) to avoid delays and traffic congestion.</li>
                <li>Keep wildlife wild: do not approach or feed animals.</li>
                <li>Drive responsibly: observe posted speed limits and use pullouts to take pictures and let other cars pass.</li>
                <li>Protect Yosemite’s bears: always practice proper food storage and follow speed limits.</li>
                <li>Staying connected: cellular service is limited. Don’t be surprised if you can’t receive calls or texts in the park.</li>
                <li>How can you help four million people? Learn how to visit Yosemite in a way that is fun, memorable, and safe.</li>
