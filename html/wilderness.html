    <h1>Wilderness Permits</h1>
    <ul class="small">
        A wilderness permit is required year-round for backpacking, overnight climbing, or any other overnight stay in the Yosemite Wilderness. A wilderness permit is not required for day hikes (unless hiking to Half Dome) or for staying in lodging facilities and frontcountry campgrounds. 
        <br>Wilderness permits are only issued to a limited number people for each trailhead in order to provide outstanding opportunities for solitude, as required by the Wilderness Act. Since many trails are very popular, reservations are required from late April through October. Of each daily quota for a trailhead, 60 percent can be reserved 24 weeks in advance. The remaining 40 percent are available seven days in advance. 
    </ul>
    <h3>Wilderness Permit Reservations</h3>
    <ul class="small">
        Sixty percent of wilderness permit reservations become available by lottery 24 weeks in advance. Of these, any remaining reservations after each week's lottery become available on a first-come, first-served basis the Friday after the lottery application period closes and are available up to three days in advance. The remaining 40% of reservations become available seven days in advance (up to three days in advance).
    </ul>
    <h3>Walk-Up Wilderness Permits</h3>
    <ul class="small">
        Any unreserved permits will be available in person at wilderness centers only on the start date of the trip. Few, if any, unused permits will be available on any given day. You must arrive at a wilderness center during business hours to get a permit. All wilderness centers operate from 8 am to 5 pm. After-hours permits are not available.
    </ul>
    <h3>Late October to mid-April</h3>
    <ul class="small">
        Most of Yosemite is covered in snow during winter. Before planning a wilderness trip during this time, please ensure you're prepared for winter conditions.
    </ul>
    <h5>Wilderness permits are required all year. You can get a wilderness permit the day before or day you intend to start your hike at the permit issuing station nearest the trailhead. While trailhead quotas are still in effect, most trailheads don't fill up. Bear canisters are only available for rental at the Valley Visitor Center.</h5>
